# DETR-Dog-Attention-Maps
Visualization of DETR model attention maps during training for dog detection. This repository contains attention map evolution, training metrics, and animations showing how a modified DETR model (with reduced complexity) progressively learns to identify dog features across training epochs. No code included - focus is on results visualization.
